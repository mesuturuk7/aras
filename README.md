# EPG

Utilities for downloading the EPG (Electronic Program Guide) for thousands of TV channels from hundreds of sources.

__IMPORTANT:__ We are no longer able to provide pre-made guides due to the disabling of GitHub Actions (Read more: https://github.com/orgs/iptv-org/discussions/12#discussioncomment-5219050). This repository now contains only utilities and configurations for downloading guides yourself.

## How to use?

To download the guide from one of the supported sites you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) installed on your computer first.

You will also need to install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) to follow these instructions.

After installing them, you need to open the [Console](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Console) (or [Terminal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(macOS)) if you have macOS) and type the following command:

```sh
git clone --depth 1 -b master https://github.com/iptv-org/epg.git
```

Then also through the Console navigate to the just downloaded `epg` folder:

```sh
cd epg
```

And install all the necessary dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Now choose one of the sources (their complete list can be found in the [/sites](https://github.com/iptv-org/epg/tree/master/sites) folder) and start downloading the guide using the command:

```sh
npm run grab -- --site=example.com
```

To download a guide in a specific language pass its [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ISO_639-1_codes) code to the `--lang` argument:

```sh
npm run grab -- --site=example.com --lang=fr
```

To override the number of days for which the program will be loaded use the `--days` argument (the default is the value specified in the site config):

```sh
npm run grab -- --site=example.com --days=3
```

To also create a compressed version of the guide, add the `--gzip` flag:

```sh
npm run grab -- --site=example.com --gzip
```

After the download is completed in the current directory will appear a new folder `guides`, which will store all XML files:

```sh
guides
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ fr
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example.com.xml
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ example.com.xml.gz
```

If you want to download the guide automatically on a schedule, you need to pass a valid [cron expression](https://crontab.guru/) to the script using the `--cron` attribute:

```sh
npm run grab -- --site=example.com --cron="0 0 * * *"
```

Also you can make these guides available via URL by running your own server:

```sh
npm run serve
```

After that all the downloaded guides will be available at a link like this:

```
http://localhost:3000/guides/fr/example.com.xml
```

In addition, they will be available on your local network at:

```
http://<your_local_ip_address>:3000/guides/fr/example.com.xml
```
